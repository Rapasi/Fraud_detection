# Credit card fraud detection using a simple neural network. Data used is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). 
## The neural network is creted using Tensorflow 2 with Keras backend. Code is in Jupyter notebook. Comments are in Finnish for this time (Code of course is not).    
## The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders and it can be downloaded from Kaggle. Dataset is extremely inbalansed so precision and recall are used for performance metrics. Weight and parameters could be tweaked to improve fraud detection accuracies.
